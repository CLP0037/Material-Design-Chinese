#### 译文

#### 译文

### 译文

[en]: <> (Shape is made visible when surface edges have sufficient contrast against their background. By default, Material Design makes shapes noticeable by using shadows to display surfaces edges. Other methods to show surface edges and shapes can be used in combination with shadows, or on their own, such as color fills and opacity, .)
